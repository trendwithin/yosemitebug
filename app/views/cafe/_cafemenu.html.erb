        If there is a place where the spirit of the Yosemite Bug resides, it must be the June Bug Cafe.
        In addition to the excellent foods and sincere service we have on offer for you, this is where
        gatherings with music, games, chatter, laughter, openness and interaction all come together.
        This restaurant would not be what it is without the blend of fresh foods and international humanity.
        The cozy mountain lodge surroundings, taps, family style dining and open kitchen surely help.

      We do look for fresh, organic & local foods in addition to our own heirloom gardens to expand
      the experience. Our attention to vegan and vegetarian foods, in addition to quality meats and
      sustainable fish show the difference. Our reflection of seasonal & California foods with a
      mountain sensibility towards value lends us our style. And what are Yosemite holidays without game!

      Talia and her talented team make the true effort that has clearly put the Cafe at the top of
      it's game. We also now have a full lunch menu, homemade pies, local produce, our own dressings,
      & full children's menus. But most importantly: the love of food.
